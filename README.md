### What is Web Developement?

A browser sends website requests to a web server, all web resources are stored on a server somewhere, called hosting. That server sends a response with all of the resources associated with that website. Those resources are going to be in three languages that web browsers understand, typically HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The browser then takes the code and renders the webpage utilizing those resources. This is the process of Web Development.

Front-End Web Development is the serving of front facing resources directly. The page contents, styles, and resource interactions.

Back-End Web Development is the development of the application and database that handle and provide data and data interactions.

### What is a static website?

All of the files are sent to the browser as they are.
(index.html, style.css, script.js)

### What is a dynamic website?

A website that generates a new isntance of the web resources when the request is sent. The application is running and provides access to the database.

### What are the three core languages of a webpage?

Html provides the content, Css provides the presentation of the content, and JS adds the dynamic effects of web applications.
