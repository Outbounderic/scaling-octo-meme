## First Tutorial HTML/CSS Focus

##### What is Web Developement?

A browser sends website requests to a web server, all web resources are stored on a server somewhere, called hosting. That server sends a response with all of the resources associated with that website. Those resources are going to be in three languages that web browsers understand, typically HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The browser then takes the code and renders the webpage utilizing those resources.
